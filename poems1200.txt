were as content and freeas i believe that thou and i should be to humoryou cannot love  my pretty heart  and why there was a time you told me that you would but now again you will the same deny if it might please you  would to god you could what  will you hate  nay  that you will not  neither nor love nor hate  how then  what will you do what  will you keep a mean then betwixt either or will you love me and yet hate me  too yet serves this not  what next  what other shift you will  and will not  what a coil is here i see your craft  now i perceive your drift and all this while i was mistaken there your love and hate is this  i now do prove you you love in hate  by hate to make me love you so shall i live  supposing thou art true like a deceived husband  so love's facemay still seem love to me  though alter'd new thy looks with me  thy heart in other place for there can live no hatred in thine eye therefore in that i cannot know thy change in many's looks  the false heart's historyis writ in moods  and frowns  and wrinkles strange but heaven in thy creation did decreethat in thy face sweet love should ever dwell whate'er thy thoughts  or thy heart's workings be thy looks should nothing thence  but sweetness tell   how like eve's apple doth thy beauty grow   if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show then hate me when thou wilt  if ever  now now  while the world is bent my deeds

night a rainy morrow to linger out a purpos'd overthrow if thou wilt leave me  do not leave me last when other petty griefs have done their spite but in the onset come  so shall i tasteat first the very worst of fortune's might   and other strains of woe  which now seem woe   compar'd with loss of thee  will not seem so love is my sin  and thy dear virtue hate hate of my sin  grounded on sinful loving o  but with mine compare thou thine own state and thou shalt find it merits not reproving or  if it do  not from those lips of thine that have profan'd their scarlet ornamentsand seal'd false

his end with care leaves to his son all he had heap'd together this new rich novice  lavish of his chest to one man gives  doth on another spend then here he riots  yet among the resthaps to lend some to one true honest friend thy gifts thou in obscurity dost waste false friends thy kindness  born but to deceive thee thy love that is on the unworthy plac'd time hath thy beauty  which with age will leave thee only that little which to me was lenti give thee back  when all the rest is spent what  dost thou mean to cheat me of my heart to take all mine and give me none again or have thine eyes such magic or that artthat what they get they ever do retain play not the tyrant  but take some remorse rebate thy spleen  if but for pity's sake or  cruel  if thou canst not  let us 'scourse and  for one piece of thine  my whole heart take but what of pity do i speak to thee whose breast is proof against complaint or prayer or can i think what my reward shall befrom that proud beauty  which was my betrayer what talk i of a heart  when thou hast none or  if thou hast  it is a flinty one an evil spirit  your beauty haunts me still wherewith  alas  i have been long possest which ceaseth not to tempt me to each ill nor gives me once but one poor minute's rest in me it speaks  whether i sleep or wake and when by means to drive it out i try with greater torments then it me doth take and tortures me in most extremity before my face it lays down my despairs and hastes me on unto a sudden death now tempting me to drown myself in tears and then in sighing to give up my breath thus am i still provok'd to every evilby this good wicked spirit  sweet angel devil as due by many titles i resignmy self to thee  o god  first i was madeby thee  and for thee  and when i was decayedthy blood

spirit divine why doth the devil then usurp on me why doth he steal  nay ravish that's thy right except thou rise and for thine own work fight oh i shall soon despair  when i do seethat thou lov'st mankind well  yet wilt not choose me and satan hates me  yet is loth to lose me no days such honored days as these  while yetfair aphrodite reigned  men seeking widefor some fair thing which should

hearts which in thy sunshine lie to sun themselves once more before they die thine eyes' blue tenderness  thy long fair hair   and the warm lustre of thy features  caught  from contemplation  where serenely wrought seems sorrow's softness charmed from its despair  have thrown such speaking sadness in thine air   that  but i know thy blessed bosom fraught  with mines of unalloyed and stainless

  'tis thee   myself   that for myself i praise   painting my age with beauty of thy days rousseau  voltaire  our gibbon  and de staël    leman  these names are worthy of thy shore   thy shore of names like these  wert thou no more their memory thy remembrance would recall to them thy banks were lovely as to all   but they have made them lovelier  for the lore  of mighty minds doth hallow in the coreof human hearts the ruin of a wall  where dwelt the wise and wondrous  but by  thee how much more  lake of beauty  do we feel   in sweetly gliding o'er thy crystal sea the wild glow of that not ungentle zeal   which of the heirs of immortalityis proud  and makes the breath of glory real whether the turkish new moon minded beto fill his horns this year on christian coast how poles' right

to me do frame i  cumber'd with good manners  answer do but know not how  for still i think of you how sweet and lovely dost thou make the shamewhich  like a canker in the fragrant rose doth spot the beauty of thy budding name o  in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose that tongue that tells the story of thy days making lascivious comments on thy sport cannot dispraise  but in a kind of praise naming thy name  blesses an ill report o  what a mansion have those vices gotwhich for their habitation chose out thee where beauty's veil doth cover every blotand all things turns to fair that eyes can see   take heed  dear heart  of this large privilege   the hardest knife ill us'd doth lose his edge not with vain tears  when we’re beyond the sun we’ll beat on the substantial doors  nor treadthose dusty high roads of the aimless deadplaintive for earth  but rather turn and rundown some close covered by way of the air some low sweet alley between wind and wind stoop under faint gleams  thread the shadows  findsome whispering ghost forgotten nook  and therespend in pure converse our eternal day think each in each  immediately wise learn all we lacked before  hear  know  and saywhat this tumultuous body now denies and feel  who have laid our groping hands away and see  no longer blinded by our eyes thy bosom is endeared with all hearts which i by lacking have supposed dead and there reigns love  and all love's loving parts and all those friends which i thought buried how many a holy and obsequious tearhath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye as interest of the dead  which now appearbut things remov'd that hidden in thee lie thou art the grave where buried love doth live hung with the trophies of my lovers gone who all their parts of me to thee did give that due of many now is thine alone   their images i lov'd  i view in thee   and thou  all they  hast all the all of me this is my play's last scene  here heavens appointmy pilgrimage's last mile  and my raceidly  yet quickly run  hath this last pace my span's last inch  my minute's latest point and gluttonous death  will instantly unjointmy body and soul  and i shall sleep a space but my ever waking part shall see that face whose fear already shakes my every joint then  as my soul  t' heaven her first seat  takes flight and earth born body in the earth shall dwell so fall my sins that all may have their right to where they're bred  and would press me  to hell impute me righteous  thus purged of evil for thus i leave the world  the flesh  the devil say that thou didst forsake me for some fault and i will comment upon that offence speak of my lameness  and i straight will halt against thy reasons making no defence thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill to set a form upon desired change as i'll myself disgrace  knowing thy will i will acquaintance strangle  and look strange be absent from thy walks  and in my tonguethy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell lest i  too much profane  should do it wrong and haply of our old acquaintance tell   for thee  against my self i'll vow debate   for i must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate farewell  ye coral caves  ye pearly sands ye waving woods that crown yon lofty steep farewell  ye nereides of the glitt'ring deep ye mountain tribes  ye fawns  ye sylvan bands on the bleak rock your frantic minstrel stands each task forgot  save that  to sigh and weep in vain the strings her burning fingers sweep no more her touch  the grecian lyre commands in circe's cave my faithless phaon's laid her daemons dress his brow with opiate flow'rs or  loit'ring in the brown pomgranate shade beguile with am'rous strains the fateful hours while sappho's lips  to paly ashes fade and sorrow's cank'ring worm her heart devours for shame  deny that thou bear'st love to any who for thy self art so unprovident grant  if thou wilt  thou art belov'd of many but that thou none lov'st is most evident for thou art so possess'd with murderous hate that 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire seeking that beauteous roof to ruinatewhich to repair should be thy chief desire o  change thy thought  that i may change my mind shall hate be fairer lodg'd than gentle love be  as thy presence is  gracious and kind or to thyself at least kind hearted prove   make thee another self for love of me   that beauty still may live in thine or thee nor judge me light  tho' light at times i seem and lightly in the stress of fortune bearthe innumerable flaws of changeful care  nor judge me light for this  nor rashly deem office forbid to mortals  kept supremeand separate the prerogative of god  that seaman idle who is borne abroadto the far haven by the favouring stream not he alone that to contrarious seasopposes  all night long  the unwearied oar not he alone  by high success endeared shall reach the port  but  winged  with some light breezeshall they  with upright keels  pass in beforewhom easy taste  the golden pilot  steered let me not to the marriage of true mindsadmit impediments  love is not lovewhich alters when it alteration finds or bends with the remover to remove o  no  it is an ever fixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken it is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown  although his height be taken love's not time's fool  though rosy lips and cheekswithin his bending sickle's compass come love alters not with his brief hours and weeks but bears it out even to the edge of doom   if this be error and upon me prov'd   i never writ  nor no man ever lov'd what's in the brain  that ink may character which hath not figur'd to thee my true spirit what's new to speak  what now to register that may express my love  or thy dear merit nothing  sweet boy  but yet  like prayers divine i must each day say o'er the very same counting no old thing old  thou mine  i thine even as when first i hallow'd thy fair name so that eternal love in love's fresh case weighs not the dust and injury of age nor gives to necessary wrinkles place but makes antiquity for aye his page   finding the first conceit of love there bred   where time and outward form would show it dead oh  yes  they love through all this world of ours i will not gainsay love  called love forsooth i have heard love talked in my early youth and since  not so long back but that the flowersthen gathered  smell still  mussulmans and giaoursthrow kerchiefs at a smile  and have no ruthfor any weeping  polypheme's white toothslips on the nut if  after frequent showers the shell is over smooth  and not so muchwill turn the thing called love  aside to hateor else to oblivion  but thou art not sucha lover  my beloved  thou canst waitthrough sorrow and sickness  to bring souls to touch and think it soon when others cry 'too late 'those hours  that with gentle work did framethe lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell will play the tyrants to the very sameand that unfair which fairly doth excel for never resting time leads summer onto hideous winter  and confounds him there sap checked with frost  and lusty leaves quite gone beauty o'er snowed and bareness every where then were not summer's distillation left a liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass beauty's effect with beauty were bereft nor it  nor no remembrance what it was   but flowers distill'd  though they with winter meet   leese but their show  their substance still lives sweet eternal spirit of the chainless mind   brightest in dungeons  liberty  thou art   for there thy habitation is the heart  the heart which love of thee alone can bind and when thy sons to fetters are consigned    to fetters  and the damp vault's dayless gloom   their country conquers with their martyrdom and freedom's fame finds wings on every wind chillon  thy prison is a holy place   and thy sad floor an altar  for 'twas trod until his very steps have left a trace  worn  as if thy cold pavement were a sod by bonnivard   may none those marks efface   for they appeal from tyranny to god let not my love be call'd idolatry nor my beloved as an idol show since all alike my songs and praises beto one  of one  still such  and ever so kind is my love to day  to morrow kind still constant in a wondrous excellence therefore my verse to constancy confin'd one thing expressing  leaves out difference 'fair  kind  and true ' is all my argument 'fair  kind  and true ' varying to other words and in this change is my invention spent three themes in one  which wondrous scope affords   fair  kind  and true  have often liv'd alone   which three till now  never kept seat in one not marble  nor the gilded monumentsof princes  shall outlive this powerful rhyme but you shall shine more bright in these contentsthan unswept stone  besmear'd with sluttish time when wasteful war shall statues overturn and broils root out the work of masonry nor mars his sword  nor war's quick fire shall burnthe living record of your memory 'gainst death  and all oblivious enmityshall you pace forth  your praise shall still find roomeven in the eyes of all posteritythat wear this world out to the ending doom   so  till the judgment that yourself arise   you live in this  and dwell in lovers' eyes when i have seen by time's fell hand defac'dthe rich proud cost of outworn buried age when sometime lofty towers i see down raz'd and brass eternal slave to mortal rage when i have seen the hungry ocean gainadvantage on the kingdom of the shore and the firm soil win of the watery main increasing store with loss  and loss with store when i have seen such interchange of state or state itself confounded  to decay ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate  that time will come and take my love away   this thought is as a death which cannot choose  but weep to have  that which it fears to lose canst thou  o cruel  say i love thee not when i against myself with thee partake do i not think on thee  when i forgotam of my self  all tyrant  for thy sake who hateth thee that i do call my friend on whom frown'st thou that i do fawn upon nay  if thou lour'st on me  do i not spendrevenge upon myself with present moan what merit do i in my self respect that is so proud thy service to despise when all my best doth worship thy defect commanded by the motion of thine eyes   but  love  hate on  for now i know thy mind   those that can see thou lov'st  and i am blind thy verse is "sad" enough  no doubt   a devilish deal more sad than witty why we should weep i can't find out   unless for  thee  we weep in pity yet there is one i pity more   and much  alas  i think he needs it for he  i'm sure  will suffer sore   who  to his own misfortune  reads it thy rhymes  without the aid of magic   may  once  be read  but never after yet their effect's by no means tragic   although by far too dull for laughter but would you make our bosoms bleed and of no common pang complain  if you would make us weep indeed tell us  you'll read them o'er again those parts of thee that the world's eye doth viewwant nothing that the thought of hearts can mend all tongues  the voice of souls  give thee that due uttering bare truth  even so as foes commend thy outward thus with outward praise is crown'd but those same tongues  that give thee so thine own in other accents do this praise confoundby seeing farther than the eye hath shown they look into the beauty of thy mind and that in guess they measure by thy deeds then  churls  their thoughts  although their eyes were kind to thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds   but why thy odour matcheth not thy show   the soil is this  that thou dost common grow whoever hath her wish  thou hast thy 'will 'and 'will' to boot  and 'will' in over plus more than enough am i that vex'd thee still to thy sweet will making addition thus wilt thou  whose will is large and spacious not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine shall will in others seem right gracious and in my will no fair acceptance shine the sea  all water  yet receives rain still and in abundance addeth to his store so thou  being rich in 'will ' add to thy 'will'one will of mine  to make thy large will more   let no unkind 'no' fair beseechers kill   think all but one  and me in that one 'will 'dang'rous to hear  is that melodious tongue and fatal to the sense those murd'rous eyes where in a sapphire sheath  love's arrow lies himself conceal'd the crystal haunts among oft o'er that form  enamour'd have i hung on that smooth cheek to mark the deep'ning dyes while from that lip the fragrant breath would rise that lip  like cupid's bow with rubies strung still let me gaze upon that polish'd brow o'er which the golden hair luxuriant plays so  on the modest lily's leaves of snowthe proud sun revels in resplendent rays warm as his beams this sensate heart shall glow till life's last hour  with phaon's self decays to the criticmethinks i see some crooked mimic jeer and tax my muse with this fantastic grace turning my papers asks  "what have we here "making withal some filthy antic face i fear no censure  nor what thou canst say nor shall my spirit one jot of vigor lose think'st thou my wit shall keep the pack horse waythat every dudgen low invention goes since sonnets thus in bundles are imprestand every drudge doth dull our satiate ear think'st thou my love shall in those rags be drestthat every dowdy  every trull  doth wear up to my pitch no common judgement flies i scorn all earthly dung bred scarabies with the same heart  i said  i'll answer theeas those  when thou shalt call me by my name lo  the vain promise  is the same  the same perplexed and ruffled by life's strategy when called before  i told how hastilyi dropped my flowers or brake off from a game to run and answer with the smile that cameat play last moment  and went on with methrough my obedience  when i answer now i drop a grave thought  break from solitude yet still my heart goes to thee ponder how not as to a single good  but all my good lay thy hand on it  best one  and allowthat no child's foot could run fast as this blood xixthe soul's rialto hath its merchandise i barter curl for curl upon that mart and from my poet's forehead to my heartreceive this lock which outweighs argosies  as purply black  as erst to pindar's eyesthe dim purpureal tresses gloomed athwartthe nine white muse brows  for this counterpart       the bay crown's shade  beloved  i surmise still lingers on thy curl  it is so black thus  with a fillet of smooth kissing breath i tie the shadows safe from gliding back and lay the gift where nothing hindereth here on my heart  as on thy brow  to lackno natural heat till mine grows cold in death o  lest the world should task you to recitewhat merit lived in me  that you should loveafter my death   dear love  forget me quite for you in me can nothing worthy prove unless you would devise some virtuous lie to do more for me than mine own desert and hang more praise upon deceased ithan niggard truth would willingly impart o  lest your true love may seem false in thisthat you for love speak well of me untrue my name be buried where my body is and live no more to shame nor me nor you   for i am shamed by that which i bring forth   and so should you  to love things nothing worth lo  as a careful housewife runs to catchone of her feather'd creatures broke away sets down her babe  and makes all swift dispatchin pursuit of the thing she would have stay whilst her neglected child holds her in chase cries to catch her whose busy care is bentto follow that which flies before her face not prizing her poor infant's discontent so runn'st thou after that which flies from thee whilst i thy babe chase thee afar behind but if thou catch thy hope  turn back to me and play the mother's part  kiss me  be kind   so will i pray that thou mayst have thy 'will '  if thou turn back and my loud crying still since i left you  mine eye is in my mind and that which governs me to go aboutdoth part his function and is partly blind seems seeing  but effectually is out for it no form delivers to the heartof bird  of flower  or shape which it doth latch of his quick objects hath the mind no part nor his own vision holds what it doth catch for if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight the most sweet favour or deformed'st creature the mountain or the sea  the day or night the crow  or dove  it shapes them to your feature   incapable of more  replete with you   my most true mind thus maketh mine untrue to me  fair friend  you never can be old for as you were when first your eye i ey'd such seems your beauty still  three winters cold have from the forests shook three summers' pride three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd in process of the seasons have i seen three april perfumes in three hot junes burn'd since first i saw you fresh  which yet are green ah  yet doth beauty like a dial hand steal from his figure  and no pace perceiv'd so your sweet hue  which methinks still doth stand hath motion  and mine eye may be deceiv'd   for fear of which  hear this thou age unbred   ere you were born was beauty's summer dead if i esteemed you less  envy would killpleasure  and leave to wonder and despairthe ministration of the thoughts that fillthe mind which  like a worm whose life may sharea portion of the unapproachable marks your creations rise as fast and fairas perfect worlds at the creator's will but such is my regard that nor your powerto soar above the heights where others  nor fame  that shadow of the unborn hourcast from the envious future on the time move one regret for his unhonoured namewho dares these words   the worm beneath the sodmay lift itself in homage of the god thus is his cheek the map of days outworn when beauty lived and died as flowers do now before these bastard signs of fair were born or durst inhabit on a living brow before the golden tresses of the dead the right of sepulchres  were shorn away to live a second life on second head ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay in him those holy antique hours are seen without all ornament  itself and true making no summer of another's green robbing no old to dress his beauty new   and him as for a map doth nature store   to show false art what beauty was of yore o might those sighs and tears return againinto my breast and eyes  which i have spent that i might in this holy discontentmourn with some fruit  as i have mourned in vain in mine idolatry what showers of rainmine eyes did waste  what griefs my heart did rent that sufferance was my sin  now i repent 'cause i did suffer i must suffer pain th' hydropic drunkard  and night scouting thief the itchy lecher  and self tickling proudhave the remembrance of past joys for reliefof comming ills  to  poor  me is allowedno ease  for long  yet vehement grief hath beenth' effect and cause  the punishment and sin not mine own fears  nor the prophetic soulof the wide world dreaming on things to come can yet the lease of my true love control supposed as forfeit to a confin'd doom the mortal moon hath her eclipse endur'd and the sad augurs mock their own presage incertainties now crown themselves assur'd and peace proclaims olives of endless age now with the drops of this most balmy time my love looks fresh  and death to me subscribes since  spite of him  i'll live in this poor rime while he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes   and thou in this shalt find thy monument   when tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent tho has made me  and shall thy work decay repair me now  for now mine end doth haste i run to death  and death meets me as fast and all my pleasures are like yesterday i dare not move my dim eyes any way despair behind  and death before doth castsuch terror  and my feeble flesh doth wasteby sin in it  which it towards hell doth weigh only thou art above  and when towards theeby thy leave i can look  i rise again but our old subtle foe so tempteth methat not one hour myself i can sustain thy grace may wing me to prevent his art and thou like adamant draw mine iron heart o  how thy worth with manners may i sing when thou art all the better part of me what can mine own praise to mine own self bring and what is't but mine own when i praise thee even for this  let us divided live and our dear love lose name of single one that by this separation i may givethat due to thee which thou deserv'st alone o absence  what a torment wouldst thou prove were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave to entertain the time with thoughts of love which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive   and that thou teachest how to make one twain   by praising him here who doth hence remain that thou art blam'd shall not be thy defect for slander's mark was ever yet the fair

eyes and prove the inner cost  this love even  all my worth  to the uttermost i should not love withal  unless that thouhadst set me an example  shown me how when first thine earnest eyes with mine were crossed and love called love  and thus  i cannot speakof love even  as a good thing of my own thy soul hath snatched up mine all faint and weak and placed it by thee on a golden throne  and that i love  o soul  we must be meek  is by thee only  whom i love alone when i consider every thing that growsholds in perfection but a little moment that this huge stage presenteth nought but showswhereon the stars in secret influence comment when i perceive that men as plants increase cheered and checked even by the self same sky vaunt in their youthful sap  at height decrease and wear their brave state out of memory then the conceit of this inconstant staysets you most rich in youth before my sight where wasteful time debateth with decayto change your day of youth to sullied night   and all in war with time for love of you   as he takes from you  i engraft you new those lips that love's own hand did make breathed forth the sound that said 'i hate' to me that languish'd for her sake but when she saw my woeful state straight in her heart did mercy come chiding that tongue that ever sweetwas us'd in giving gentle doom and taught it thus anew to greet 'i hate' she alter'd with an end that followed it as gentle day doth follow night  who like a fiendfrom heaven to hell is flown away   'i hate'  from hate away she threw   and sav'd my life  saying 'not you' weary with toil  i haste me to my bed the dear respose for limbs with travel tir'd but then begins a journey in my headto work my mind  when body's work's expired for then my thoughts  from far where i abide  intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee and keep my drooping eyelids open wide looking on darkness which the blind do see save that my soul's imaginary sightpresents thy shadow to my sightless view which  like a jewel  hung in ghastly night makes black night beauteous  and her old face new   lo  thus  by day my limbs  by night my mind   for thee  and for myself  no quiet find my heart the anvil where my thoughts do beat my words the hammers fashioning my desire my breast the forge including all the heat love is the fuel which maintains the fire my sighs the bellows which the flame increaseth filling mine ears with noise and nightly groaning toiling with pain  my labor never ceaseth in grievous passions my woes still bemoaning my eyes with tears against the fire striving whose scorching gleed my heart to cinders turneth but with these drops the flame again reviving still more and more it to my torment turneth with sisyphus thus do i roll the stone and turn the wheel with damned ixion to such as say thy love i overprize and do not stick to term my praises folly against these folks  that think themselves so wise i thus oppose my reason's forces wholly though i give more than well affords my state in which expense the most suppose me vain which yields them nothing at the easiest rate yet at this price returns me treble gain they value not  unskillful how to use and i give much  because i gain thereby i that thus take  or they that thus refuse whether are these deceived then  or i in everything i hold this maxim still the circumstance doth make it good or ill since there's no help  come  let us kiss and part nay  i have done  you get no more of me and i am glad  yea  glad with all my heart that thus so cleanly i myself can free shake hands for ever  cancel all our vows and when we meet at any time againbe it not seen in either of our browsthat we one jot of former love retain now at the last gasp of love's latest breath when  his pulse failing  passion speechless lies when faith is kneeling by his bed of death and innocence is closing up his eyes now  if thou wouldst  when all have giv'n him over from death to life thou might'st him yet recover being your slave what should i do but tend upon the hours  and times of your desire i have no precious time at all to spend nor services to do  till you require nor dare i chide the world without end hour whilst i  my sovereign  watch the clock for you nor think the bitterness of absence sour when you have bid your servant once adieu nor dare i question with my jealous thoughtwhere you may be  or your affairs suppose but  like a sad slave  stay and think of noughtsave  where you are  how happy you make those   so true a fool is love  that in your will   though you do anything  he thinks no ill cupid

make them cruel for well thou know'st to my dear doting heartthou art the fairest and most precious jewel yet  in good faith  some say that thee behold thy face hath not the power to make love groan to say they err i dare not be so bold although i swear it to myself alone and to be sure that is not false i swear a thousand groans  but thinking on thy face one on another's neck  do witness bearthy black is fairest in my judgment's place   in nothing art thou black save in thy deeds   and thence this slander  as i think  proceeds the forward violet thus did i chide  sweet thief  whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells if not from my love's breath  the purple pridewhich on thy soft cheek for complexion dwellsin my love's veins thou hast too grossly dy'd the lily i condemned for thy

reviewthe very part was consecrate to thee the earth can have but earth  which is his due my spirit is thine  the better part of me so then thou hast but lost the dregs of life the prey of worms  my body being dead the coward conquest of a wretch's knife too base of thee to be remembered   the worth of that is that which it contains   and that is this  and this with thee remains as love and i

"as well " saith he  "too forward as too slow" "fortune assists the boldest " i reply "a hasty man " quoth he  "ne'er wanted woe" "labor is light where love " quoth i  "doth pay" saith he  "light burden's heavy  if far borne" quoth i  "the main lost  cast the bye away" "you have spun a fair thread " he replies in scorn and having thus awhile each other thwarted fools as we met  so fools again we parted so oft have i invoked thee for my muse and found such fair assistance in my verseas every alien pen hath got my useand under thee their poesy disperse thine eyes  that taught the dumb on high to singand heavy ignorance aloft to fly have added feathers to the learned's wingand given grace a double majesty yet be most proud of that which i compile whose influence is thine  and born of thee in others' works thou dost but mend the style and arts with thy sweet graces graced be   but thou art all my art  and dost advance  as high as learning  my rude ignorance if my dear love were but

bitter sweet that's not for me love soars from earth to ecstasies unwist love is flung lucifer like from heaven to hell but    there are wanderers in the middle mist who cry for shadows  clutch  and cannot tellwhether they love at all  or  loving  whom an old song's lady  a fool in fancy dress or phantoms  or their own face on the gloom for love of love  or from heart's loneliness pleasure's not

heart to be the chiefest guest no other drink would serve this glutton's turnbut precious tears distilling from mine eyne which with my sighs this epicure doth burn quaffing carouses in this costly

undaunted wing hast thou not dragged diana from her car   and driven the hamadryad from the woodto seek a shelter in some happier star   hast thou not torn the naiad from her flood the elfin from the green grass  and from methe summer dream beneath the tamarind tree press'd by the moon  mute arbitress of tides while the loud equinox its power combines the sea no more its swelling surge confines but o'er the shrinking land sublimely rides the wild blast  rising from the western cave drives the huge billows from their heaving bed tears from their grassy tombs the village dead and breaks the silent sabbath of the grave with shells and sea weed mingled  on the shorelo  their bones whiten in the frequent wave but vain to them the winds and waters rave they hear the warring elements no more while i am doom'd by life's long storm opprest to gaze with envy on their gloomy rest against that time  if ever that time come when i shall see thee frown on my defects when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum call'd to that audit by advis'd respects against that time when thou shalt strangely pass and scarcely greet me with that sun  thine eye when love  converted from the thing it was shall reasons find of settled gravity against that time do i ensconce me here within the knowledge of mine own desert and this my hand  against my self uprear to guard the lawful reasons on thy part   to leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws   since why to love i can allege no cause o  call not me to justify the wrongthat thy unkindness lays upon my heart wound me not with thine eye  but with thy tongue use power with power  and slay me not by art tell me thou lov'st elsewhere  but in my sight dear heart  forbear to glance thine eye aside what need'st thou wound with cunning  when thy mightis more than my o'erpress'd defence can bide let me excuse thee  ah  my love well knowsher pretty looks have been mine enemies and therefore from my face she turns my foes that they elsewhere might dart their injuries   yet do not so  but since i am near slain   kill me outright with looks  and rid my pain the face of all the world is changed  i think since first i heard the footsteps of thy soulmove still  oh  still  beside me  as they stolebetwixt me and the dreadful outer brinkof obvious death  where i  who thought to sink was caught up into love  and taught the wholeof life in a new rhythm  the cup of dolegod gave for baptism  i am fain to drink and praise its sweetness  sweet  with thee anear the names of country  heaven  are changed awayfor where thou art or shalt be  there or here and this       this lute and song       loved yesterday  the singing angels know  are only dearbecause thy name moves right in what they say some men there be which like my method welland much commend the strangeness of my vein some say i have a passing pleasing strain some say that im my humor i excel some  who not kindly relish my conceit they say  as poets do  i use to feign and in bare words paint out my passion's pain thus sundry men their sundry words repeat i pass not  i  how men affected be nor who commends or discommends my verse it pleaseth me  if i my woes rehearse and in my lines if she my love may see only my comfort still consists in this writing her praise i cannot write amiss love is too young to know what conscience is yet who knows not conscience is born of love then  gentle cheater  urge not my amiss lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove for  thou betraying me  i do betraymy nobler part to my gross body's treason my soul doth tell my body that he maytriumph in love  flesh stays no farther reason but rising at thy name doth point out thee as his triumphant prize  proud of this pride he is contented thy poor drudge to be to stand in thy affairs

doubtlest the world  flesh  yea  devil put thee out that time of year thou mayst in me beholdwhen yellow leaves  or none  or few  do hangupon those boughs which shake against the cold bare ruin'd choirs  where late the sweet birds sang in me thou see'st the twilight of such dayas after sunset fadeth in the west which by and by black night doth take away death's second self  that seals up all in rest in me thou see'st the glowing of such fire that on the ashes of his youth doth lie as the death bed  whereon it must expire consum'd with that which it was nourish'd by   this thou perceiv'st  which makes thy love more strong   to love that well  which thou must leave ere long when most i wink  then do mine eyes best see for all the day they view things unrespected but when i sleep  in dreams they look on thee and darkly bright  are bright in dark directed then thou  whose shadow shadows doth make bright how would thy shadow's form form happy showto the clear day with thy much clearer light when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so how would  i say  mine eyes be blessed madeby looking on thee in the living day when in dead night thy fair imperfect shadethrough heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay   all days are nights to see till i see thee   and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me love's lunacywhy do i speak of joy  or write of love when my heart is the very den of horror and in my soul the pains of hell i prove with all his torments and infernal terror what should i say  what yet remains to do my brain is dry with weeping all too long my sighs be spent in uttering my woe and i want words wherewith to tell my wrong but  still distracted in love's lunacy and  bedlam like  thus raging in my grief now rail upon her hair  then on her eye now call her goddess  then i call her thief now i deny her  then i do confess her now do i curse her  then again i bless her is it for fear to wet a widow's eye that thou consum'st thy self in single life ah  if thou issueless shalt hap to die the world will wail thee like a makeless wife the world will be thy widow and still weepthat thou no form of thee hast left behind when every private widow well may keepby children's eyes  her husband's shape in mind look  what an unthrift in the world doth spendshifts but his place  for still the world enjoys it but beauty's waste hath in the world an end and kept unused the user so destroys it   no love toward others in that bosom sits  that on himself such murd'rous shame commits why should your fair eyes with such sovereign gracedisperse their rays on every vulgar spirit whilst i in darkness  in the self same place get not one glance to recompense my merit so doth the plowman gaze the wand'ring star and only rest contented with the light that never learn'd what constellations arebeyond the bent of his unknowing sight o why should beauty  custom to obey to their gross sense apply herself so ill would god i were as ignorant as they when i am made

color black why wrapp'd she beams so bright would she in beamy black  like painter wise frame daintiest lustre  mix'd of shades and light or did she else that sober hue devise in object best to knit and strength our sight lest if no veil those brave gleams did disguise they sun like should more dazzle than delight or would she her miraculous power show that whereas black seems beauty's contrary she even if black doth make all beauties flow both so and thus  she minding love shoud beplaced ever there  gave him this mourning weed to honor all their deaths  who for her bleed let me confess that we two must be twain although our undivided loves are one so shall those blots that do with me remain without thy help  by me be borne alone in our two loves there is but one respect though in our lives a separable spite which though it alter not love's sole effect yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight i may not evermore acknowledge thee lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame

all my grief and yet it may be said i loved her dearly that she hath thee is of my wailing chief a loss in love that touches me more nearly loving offenders thus i will excuse ye thou dost love her

that loss both find each other  and i lose both twain and both for my sake lay on me this cross   but here's the joy  my friend and i are one   sweet flattery  then she loves but me alone bright star of beauty  on whose eyelids sita thousand nymph like and enamour'd graces the goddesses of memory and wit which there in order take their several places in whose dear bosom sweet delicious lovelays

made i hold that vile which vulgar wit affords in me's that faith which time cannot invade let what i praise be still made good by you be you most worthy  whilst i am most true in the old age black was not counted fair or if it were  it bore not beauty's name but now is black beauty's successive heir and beauty slander'd with a bastard shame for since each hand hath put on nature's power fairing the foul with art's false borrowed face sweet beauty hath no name  no holy bower but is profan'd  if not lives in disgrace therefore my mistress' eyes are raven black her eyes so suited  and they mourners seemat such who  not born fair  no beauty lack sland'ring creation with a false esteem   yet so they mourn becoming of their woe   that every tongue says beauty should look so love  banish'd heav'n  on earth was held in scorn wand'ring abroad in need and beggary and wanting friends  though of a goddess born yet crav'd the alms of such as passed by i  like a man devout and charitable clothed the naked  lodg'd this wand'ring guest with sighs and tears still furnishing his tablewith what might make the miserable blest but this ungrateful  for my good desert entic'd my thoughts

am a little world made cunninglyof elements  and an angelic sprite but black sin hath betrayed to endless nightmy worlds both parts  and  oh   both parts must die you which beyond that heaven which was most highhave found new spheres  and of new lands can write pour new seas in mine eyes  that so i mightdrown my world with my weeping earnestly or wash it if it must be drowned no more but oh it must be burnt  alas the fireof lust and envy have burnt it heretofore and made it fouler  let their flames retire and burn me  o lord  with a fiery zealof thee and thy house  which doth in eating heal with how sad steps  o moon  thou climb'st the skies how silently  and with how wan a face what  may it be that even in heavenly placethat busy archer his sharp arrows tries sure  if that long with

there   ungratefulness a woman's face with nature's own hand painted hast thou  the master mistress of my passion a woman's gentle heart  but not acquaintedwith shifting change  as is false women's

hours and many maiden gardens  yet unset with virtuous wish would bear you living flowers much liker than your painted counterfeit so should the lines of life that life repair which this  time's pencil  or my pupil pen neither in inward worth nor outward fair can make you live your self in eyes of men   to give away yourself  keeps yourself still   and you must live  drawn by your own sweet skill no  time  thou shalt not boast that i do change thy pyramids built up with newer mightto me are nothing novel  nothing strange they are but dressings of a former sight our dates are brief  and therefore we admirewhat thou dost foist upon us that is old and rather make them born to our desirethan think that we before have heard them told thy registers and thee i both defy not wondering at the present nor the past for thy records and what we see doth lie made more or less by thy continual haste   this i do vow and this shall ever be   i will be true despite thy scythe and thee when forty winters shall besiege thy brow and dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now will be a tatter'd weed of small worth held then being asked  where all thy beauty lies where all the treasure of thy lusty days to say  within thine own deep sunken eyes were an all eating shame  and thriftless praise how much more praise deserv'd thy beauty's use if thou couldst answer 'this fair child of mineshall sum my count  and make my old excuse 'proving his beauty by succession thine   this were to be new made when thou art old   and see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold farewell  thou art too dear for my possessing and like enough thou know'st thy estimate the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing my bonds in thee are all determinate for how do i hold thee but by thy granting and for that riches where is my deserving the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting and so my patent back again is swerving thy self thou gav'st  thy own worth then not knowing or me to whom thou gav'st it  else mistaking so thy great gift  upon misprision growing comes home again  on better judgement making   thus have i had thee  as a dream doth flatter   in sleep a king  but waking no such matter how heavy do i journey on the way when what i seek  my weary travel's end doth teach that ease and that repose to say 'thus far the miles are measured from thy friend 'the beast that bears me  tired with my woe plods dully on  to bear that weight in me as if by some instinct the wretch did knowhis rider lov'd not speed  being made from thee the bloody spur cannot provoke him on that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide which heavily he answers with a groan more sharp to me than spurring to his side   for that same groan doth put this in my mind   my grief lies onward  and my joy behind love steals unheeded o'er the tranquil mind as summer breezes fan the sleeping main slow through each fibre creeps the subtle pain 'till closely round the yielding bosom twin'd vain is the hope the magic to unbind the potent mischief riots in the brain grasps ev'ry thought  and burns in ev'ry vein 'till in the heart the tyrant lives enshrin'd oh  victor strong  bending the vanquish'd frame sweet is the thraldom that thou bid'st us prove and sacred is the tear thy victims claim for blest are those whom sighs of sorrow move then nymphs beware how ye profane my name nor blame my weakness  till like me ye love to the river otterdear native brook  wild streamlet of the west how many various fated years have past what happy and what mournful hours  since lasti skimm'd the smooth thin stone along thy breast numbering its light leaps  yet so deep imprestsink the sweet scenes of childhood  that mine eyesi never shut amid the sunny ray but straight with all their tints thy waters rise thy crossing plank  thy marge with willows grey and bedded sand that vein'd with various dyesgleam'd through thy bright transparence  on my way visions of childhood  oft have ye beguil'dlone manhood's cares  yet waking fondest sighs ah  that once more i were a careless child o  never say that i was false of heart though absence seem'd my flame to qualify as easy might i from my self departas from my soul which in thy breast doth lie that is my home of love  if i have rang'd like him that travels  i return again just to the time  not with the time exchang'd so that myself bring water for my stain never believe though in my nature reign'd all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood that it could so preposterously be stain'd to leave for nothing all thy sum of good   for nothing this wide universe i call   save thou  my rose  in it thou art my all to timestay  speedy time  behold  before thou pass from age to age what thou hast sought to see one in whom all the excellencies be in whom heav'n looks itself as in a glass time  look thyself in this tralucent glass and thy youth past in this pure mirror see as the world's beauty in his infancy what is was then  and thou before it was pass on  and to posterity tell this yet see thou tell but truly what hath been say to our nephews that thou once hast seenin perfect human shape all heav'nly bliss and bid them mourn  nay more  despair with thee that she is gone  her like again to see some flowers are withered and some joys have died the garden reeks with an east indian scentfrom beds where gillyflowers stand weak and spent the white heat pales the skies from side to side but in still lakes and rivers  cool  content like starry blooms on a new firmament white lilies float and regally abide in vain the cruel skies their hot rays shed the lily does not feel their brazen glare in vain the pallid clouds refuse to sharetheir dews  the lily feels no thirst  no dread unharmed she lifts her queenly face and head she drinks of living waters and keeps fair wilt thou love god  as he thee  then digest my soul  this wholesome meditation how god the spirit  by angels waited onin heaven  doth make his temple in thy breast the father having begot a son most blest and still begetting   for he ne'er be gone hath deigned to choose thee by adoption co heir t' his glory  and sabbath' endless rest and as a robbed man  which by search doth findhis stol'n stuff sold  must lose or buy 't again the son of glory came down  and was slain us whom he'd made  and satan stol'n  to unbind 'twas much that man was made like god before but  that god should be made like man  much more mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd thy beauty's form in table of my heart my body is the frame wherein 'tis held and perspective it is best painter's art for through the painter must you see his skill to find where your true image pictur'd lies which in my bosom's shop is hanging still that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done mine eyes have drawn thy shape  and thine for meare windows to my breast  where through the sundelights to peep  to gaze therein on thee   yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art   they draw but what they see  know not the heart month which the warring ancients strangely styledthe month of war   as if in their fierce wayswere any month of peace   in thy rough daysi find no war in nature  though the wildwinds clash and clang  and broken boughs are piledas feet of writhing trees  the violets raisetheir heads without affright  without amaze and sleep through all the din  as sleeps a child and he who watches well may well discernsweet expectation in each living thing like pregnant mother the sweet earth doth yearn in secret joy makes ready for the spring and hidden  sacred  in her breast doth bearannunciation lilies for the year oh my black soul  now art thou summonedby sickness  death's herald  and champion thou art like a pilgrim  which abroad hath donetreason  and durst not turn to whence he is fled or like a thief  which till death's doom be read wisheth himself delivered from prison but damned and haled to execution wisheth that still he might be imprisoned yet grace  if thou repent  thou canst not lack but who shall give thee that grace to begin oh make thy self with holy mourning black and red with blushing  as thou art with sin or wash thee in christ's blood  which hath this mightthat being red  it dyes red souls to whiteas a decrepit father takes delightto see his active child do deeds of youth so i  made lame by fortune's dearest spite take all my comfort of thy worth and truth for whether beauty  birth  or wealth  or wit or any of these all  or all  or more entitled in thy parts  do crowned sit i make my love engrafted  to this store so then i am not lame  poor  nor despis'd whilst that this shadow doth such substance givethat i in thy abundance am suffic'd and by a part of all thy glory live   look what is best  that best i wish in thee   this wish i have  then ten times happy me o  that you were your self  but  love you areno longer yours  than you your self here live against this coming end you should prepare and your sweet semblance to some other give so should that beauty which you hold in leasefind no determination  then you wereyourself again  after yourself's decease when your sweet issue your sweet form should bear who lets so fair a house fall to decay which husbandry in honour might uphold against the stormy gusts of winter's dayand barren rage of death's eternal cold   o  none but unthrifts  dear my love  you know   you had a father  let your son say so o truant muse what shall be thy amendsfor thy neglect of truth in beauty dy'd both truth and beauty on my love depends so dost thou too  and therein dignified make answer muse  wilt thou not haply say 'truth needs no colour  with his colour fix'd beauty no pencil  beauty's truth to lay but best is best  if never intermix'd' because he needs no praise  wilt thou be dumb excuse not silence so  for't lies in theeto make him much outlive a gilded tomband to be prais'd of ages yet to be   then do thy office  muse  i teach thee how  to make him seem long hence as he shows now why didst thou promise such a beauteous day and make me travel forth without my cloak to let base clouds o'ertake me in my way hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke 'tis not enough that through the cloud thou break to dry the rain on my storm beaten face for no man well of such a salve can speak that heals the wound  and cures not the disgrace nor can thy shame give physic to my grief though thou repent  yet i have still the loss the offender's sorrow lends but weak reliefto him that bears the strong offence's cross   ah  but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds   and they are rich and ransom all ill deeds ye hasten to the grave  what seek ye there ye restless thoughts and busy purposesof the idle brain  which the world's livery wear o thou quick heart  which pantest to possessall that pale expectation feigneth fair thou vainly curious mind which wouldest guesswhence thou didst come  and whither thou must go and all that never yet was known would know  oh  whither hasten ye  that thus ye press with such swift feet life's green and pleasant path seeking  alike from happiness and woe a refuge in the cavern of gray death o heart  and mind  and thoughts  what thing do youhope to inherit in the grave below shall i compare thee to a summer's day thou art more lovely and more temperate rough winds do shake the darling buds of may and summer's lease hath all too short a date sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines and often is his gold complexion dimm'd and every fair from fair sometime declines by chance  or nature's changing course untrimm'd but thy eternal summer shall not fade nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade when in eternal lines to time thou grow'st   so long as men can breathe  or eyes can see   so long lives this  and this gives life to thee some glory in their birth  some in their skill some in their wealth  some in their body's force some in their garments though new fangled ill some in their hawks and hounds  some in their horse and every humour hath his adjunct pleasure wherein it finds a joy above the rest but these particulars are not my measure all these i better in one general best thy love is better than high birth to me richer than wealth  prouder than garments' costs of more delight than hawks and horses be and having thee  of all men's pride i boast   wretched in this alone  that thou mayst take  all this away  and me most wretchcd make if faithful souls be alike glorifiedas angels  then my fathers soul doth see and adds this even to full felicity that valiantly i hells wide mouth o'erstride but if our minds to these souls be descriedby circumstances  and by signs that beapparent in us  not immediately how shall my mind's white truth by them be tried they see idolatrous lovers weep and mourn and vile blasphemous conjurers to callon jesus name  and pharisaicaldissemblers feigne devotion  then turn o pensive soul  to god  for he knows bestthy true grief  for he put it in my breast my love is strengthen'd  though more weak in seeming i love not less  though less the show appear that love is merchandiz'd  whose rich esteeming the owner's tongue doth publish every where our love was new  and then but in the spring when i was wont to greet it with my lays as philomel in summer's front doth sing and stops her pipe in growth of riper days not that the summer is less pleasant nowthan when her mournful hymns did hush the night but that wild music burthens every bough and sweets grown common lose their dear delight   therefore like her  i sometime hold my tongue   because i would not dull you with my song o me  what eyes hath love put in my head which have no correspondence with true sight or  if they have  where is my judgment fled that censures falsely what they see aright if that be fair whereon my false eyes dote what means the world to say it is not so if it be not  then love doth well denotelove's eye is not so true as all men's  no how can it  o  how can love's eye be true that is so vexed with watching and with tears no marvel then  though i mistake my view the sun itself sees not  till heaven clears   o cunning love  with tears thou keep'st me blind   lest eyes well seeing thy foul faults should find betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took and each doth good turns now unto the other when that mine eye is famish'd for a look or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother with my love's picture then my eye doth feast and to the painted banquet bids my heart another time mine eye is my heart's guest and in his thoughts of love doth share a part so  either by thy picture or my love thy self away  art present still with me for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move and i am still with them  and they with thee   or  if they sleep  thy picture in my sight  awakes my heart  to heart's and eye's delight oh sigh  thou steal'st  the herald of the breast the lover's fears  the lover's pangs to tell thou bid'st with timid grace the bosom swell cheating the day of joy  the night of rest oh  lucid tears  with eloquence confest why on my fading cheek unheeded dwell meek  as the dew drops on the flowret's bellby ruthless tempests to the green sod prest fond sigh be hush'd  congeal  o  slighted tear thy feeble pow'rs the busy fates control or if thy crystal streams again appear let them  like lethe's  oblivion roll for love the tyrant plays  when hope is near and she who flies the lover  chains the soul why is my verse so barren of new pride so far from variation or quick change why with the time do i not glance asideto new found methods  and to compounds strange why write i still all one  ever the same and keep invention in a noted weed that every word doth almost tell my name showing their birth  and where they did proceed o  know sweet love i always write of you and you and love are still my argument so all my best is dressing old words new spending again what is already spent   for as the sun is daily new and old   so is my love still telling what is told when my love swears that she is made of truth i do believe her though i know she lies that she might think me some untutor'd youth unlearned in the world's false subtleties thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young although she knows my days are past the best simply i credit her false speaking tongue on both sides thus is simple truth suppressed but wherefore says she not she is unjust and wherefore say not i that i am old o  love's best habit is in seeming trust and age in love  loves not to have years told   therefore i lie with her  and she with me   and in our faults by lies we flatter'd be was it the proud full sail of his great verse bound for the prize of all too precious you that did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse making their tomb the womb wherein they grew was it his spirit  by spirits taught to write above a mortal pitch  that struck me dead no  neither he  nor his compeers by nightgiving him aid  my verse astonished he  nor that affable familiar ghostwhich nightly gulls him with intelligence as victors of my silence cannot boast i was not sick of any fear from thence   but when your countenance fill'd up his line   then lacked i matter  that enfeebled mine an allusion to the phoenix'mongst all the creatures in this spacious roundof the birds' kind  the phoenix is alone which best by you of living things is known none like to that  none like to you is found your beauty is the hot and splend'rous sun the precious spices be your chaste desire which being kindled by that heav'nly fire your life so like the phoenix's begun yourself thus burned in that sacred flame with so rare sweetness all the heav'ns perfuming again increasing as you are consuming only by dying born the very same and  wing'd by fame  you to the stars ascend so you of time shall live beyond the end at the round earth's imagined corners blowyour trumpets  angels  and arise  arisefrom death  you numberless infinitiesof souls  and to your scattered bodies go all whom the flood did  and fire shall  overthrow all whom war  dearth  age  agues  tyrannies despair  law  chance  hath slain  and you whose eyesshall behold god  and never taste death's woe but let them sleep  lord  and me mourn a space for  if above all these my sins abound 'tis late to ask abundance of thy grace when we are there  here on this lowly groundteach me how to repent  for that's as goodas if thou'dst sealed my pardon  with thy blood oh  ye bright stars  that on the ebon fieldsof heav'n's empire  trembling seems to stand 'till rosy morn unlocks her portal bland where the proud sun his fiery banner wields to flames  less fierce than mine  your lustre yields and pow'rs more strong my countless tears command love strikes the feeling heart with ruthless hand and only spares the breast which dullness shields since  then  capricious nature but bestowsthe fine affections of the soul  to provea keener sense of desolating woes far  far from me the empty boast remove if bliss from coldness  pain from passion flows ah  who would wish to feel  or learn to love in loving thee thou know'st i am forsworn but thou art twice forsworn  to me love swearing in act thy bed vow broke  and new faith torn in vowing new hate after new love bearing but why of two oaths' breach do i accuse thee when i break twenty  i am perjur'd most for all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee and all my honest faith in thee is lost for i have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness oaths of thy love  thy truth  thy constancy and  to enlighten thee  gave eyes to blindness or made them swear against the thing they see   for i have sworn thee fair  more perjur'd i   to swear against the truth so foul a lie alack  what poverty my muse brings forth that having such a scope to show her pride the argument  all bare  is of more worththan when it hath my added praise beside o  blame me not  if i no more can write look in your glass  and there appears a facethat over goes my blunt invention quite dulling my lines  and doing me disgrace were it not sinful then  striving to mend to mar the subject that before was well for to no other pass my verses tendthan of your graces and your gifts to tell   and more  much more  than in my verse can sit   your own glass shows you when you look in it thus can my love excuse the slow offenceof my dull bearer when from thee i speed from where thou art why should i haste me thence till i return  of posting is no need o  what excuse will my poor beast then find when swift extremity can seem but slow then should i spur  though mounted on the wind in winged speed no motion shall i know then can no horse with my desire keep pace therefore desire  of perfect'st love being made shall neigh  no dull flesh  in his fiery race but love  for love  thus shall excuse my jade     'since from thee going  he went wilful slow   towards thee i'll run  and give him leave to go 'some say thy fault is youth  some wantonness some say thy

so are those errors that in thee are seento truths translated  and for true things deem'd how many lambs might the stern wolf betray if like a lamb he could his looks translate how many gazers mightst thou lead away if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state   but do not so  i love thee in such sort   as  thou being mine  mine is thy good report who is it that says most  which can say more

beauty of your eyes and in fresh numbers number all your graces the age to come would say 'this poet lies such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces 'so should my papers  yellow'd with their age be scorn'd  like old men of less truth than tongue and your true rights be term'd a poet's rageand stretched metre of an antique song   but were some child of yours alive that time   you should

pale ghost  upon th' elysian shore shall smile  releas'd from ev'ry mortal care whil  doom'd love's victim to repine no more my breast shall bathe in endless rapture there ah  no my restless shade would still deplore nor taste that bliss  which phaon did not share how can i then return in happy plight that am debarre'd the benefit of rest when day's oppression is not eas'd by night but day by night and night by day oppress'd and each  though enemies to either's reign do in consent shake hands to torture me the one by toil  the other to complainhow far i toil  still farther off from thee i

for a lover's grave and there shall phaon pearls of pity shed to gem the vanquish'd heart he scorn'd to save two loves i have of comfort and despair which like two spirits do suggest me still the better angel is a man right fair the worser spirit a woman colour'd ill to win me soon to hell  my female evil tempteth my better angel from my side and would corrupt my saint to be a devil wooing his purity with her foul pride and whether that my angel be turn'd fiend suspect i may  yet not directly tell but being both from me  both to each friend i guess one angel in another's hell   yet this shall i ne'er know  but live in doubt   till my bad angel fire my good one out my mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun coral is far more red  than her lips red if snow be white  why then her breasts are dun if hairs be wires  black wires grow on her head i have seen roses damask'd  red and white but no such roses see i in her cheeks and in some perfumes is there more delightthan in the breath that from my mistress reeks i love to hear her speak  yet well i knowthat music hath a far more pleasing sound i grant i never saw a goddess go   my mistress  when she walks  treads on the ground   and yet by heaven  i think my love as rare   as any she belied with false compare i never saw that you did painting need and therefore to your fair no painting set i found  or thought i found  you did exceedthat barren tender of a poet's debt and therefore have i slept in your report that you yourself  being extant  well might showhow far a modern quill doth come too short speaking of worth  what worth in you doth grow this silence for my sin you did impute which shall be most my glory being dumb for i impair not beauty being mute when others would give life  and bring a tomb   there lives more life in one of your fair eyes  than both your poets can in praise devise what if this present were the world's last night mark in my heart  o soul  where thou dost dwell the picture of christ crucified  and tellwhether that countenance can thee affright tears in his eyes quench the amazing light blood fills his frowns  which from his pierced head fell and can that tongue adjudge thee unto hell which prayed forgiveness for his foes' fierce spite no  no  but as in my idolatryi said to all my profane mistresses beauty  of pity  foulness only isa sign of rigour  so i say to thee to wicked spirits are horrid shapes assigned this beauteous form assures a piteous mind and yet  because thou overcomest so because thou art more noble and like a king thou canst prevail against my fears and flingthy purple round me  till my heart shall growtoo close against thine heart henceforth to knowhow it shook when alone  why  conqueringmay prove as lordly and complete a thingin lifting upward  as in crushing low and as a vanquished soldier yields his swordto one who lifts him from the bloody earth even so  beloved  i at last record here ends my strife  if thou invite me forth i rise above abasement at the word make thy love larger to enlarge my worth yet read at last the story of my woe the dreary abstracts of my endless cares with my life's sorrow interlined so smok'd with my sighs and blotted with my tears the sad memorials of my miseries penn'd in the grief of mine afflicted ghost my life's complaint in doleful elegies with so pure love as time could never boast receive the incense which i offer here by my strong faith ascending to thy fame my zeal  my hope  my vows  my praise  my prayer my soul's oblation to thy sacred name which name my muse to highest heav'ns shall raiseby chaste desire  true love  and virtuous praise most wonderful and strange it seems  that iwho but a little time ago was tosthigh on the waves of passion and of pain with aching heat and wildly throbbing brain who peered into the darkness  deeming vainall things there found if but one thing were lost thus calm and still and silent here should lie watching and waiting    waiting passively the dark has faded  and before mine eyeshave long  grey flats expanded  dim and bare and through the changing guises all things wearinevitable law i recognise yet in my heart a hint of feeling lieswhich half a hope and half a despair against my love shall be as i am now with time's injurious hand crush'd and o'erworn when hours have drain'd his blood and fill'd his browwith lines and wrinkles  when his youthful mornhath travell'd on to age's steepy night and all those beauties whereof now he's kingare vanishing  or vanished out of sight stealing away the treasure of his spring for such a time do i now fortifyagainst confounding age's cruel knife that he shall never cut from memorymy sweet love's beauty  though my lover's life   his beauty shall in these black lines be seen   and they shall live  and he in them still green thy gift  thy tables  are within my brainfull character'd with lasting memory which shall above that idle rank remain beyond all date  even to eternity or  at the least  so long as brain and hearthave faculty by nature to subsist till each to raz'd oblivion yield his partof thee  thy record never can be miss'd that poor retention could not so much hold nor need i tallies thy dear love to score therefore to give them from me was i bold to trust those tables that receive thee more   to keep an adjunct to remember thee  were to import forgetfulness in me lift not the painted veil which those who livecall life  though unreal shapes be pictured there and it but mimic all we would believewith colours idly spread   behind  lurk fearand hope  twin destinies  who ever weavetheir shadows  o'er the chasm  sightless and drear i knew one who had lifted it  he sought for his lost heart was tender  things to lovebut found them not  alas  nor was there aughtthe world contains  the which he could approve through the unheeding many he did move a splendour among shadows  a bright blotupon this gloomy scene  a spirit that strovefor truth  and like the preacher found it not farewell  ye tow'ring cedars  in whose shade lull'd by the nightingale  i sunk to rest while spicy breezes hover'd o'er my breastto fan my cheek  in deep'ning tints array'd while am'rous insects  humming round me  play'd each flow'r forsook  of prouder sweets in quest of glowing lips  in humid fragrance drest that mock'd the sunny hybla's vaunted aid farewell  ye limpid rivers  oh  farewell no more shall sappho to your grots repair no more your white waves to her bosom swell or your dank weeds  entwine her floating hair as erst  when venus in her sparry

blue depths of heaven   unlike the fire thou bearest  soon shalt thoufade like a meteor in surrounding gloom whilst that  unquenchable  is doomed to glowa watch light by the patriot's lonely tomb a ray of courage to the oppressed and poor a spark  though gleaming on the hovel's hearth which through the tyrant's gilded domes shall roar a beacon in the darkness of the earth a sun which  o'er the renovated scene shall dart like truth where falsehood yet has been from you have i been absent in the spring when proud pied april  dress'd in all his trim hath put a spirit of youth in every thing that heavy saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him yet nor the lays of birds  nor the sweet smellof different flowers in odour and in hue could make me any summer's story tell or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew nor did i wonder at the lily's white nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose they were but sweet  but figures of delight drawn after you  you pattern of all those   yet seem'd it winter still  and you away   as with your shadow i with these did play tired with all these  for restful death i cry as to behold desert a beggar born and needy nothing trimm'd in jollity and purest faith unhappily forsworn and gilded honour shamefully misplac'd and maiden virtue rudely strumpeted and right perfection wrongfully disgrac'd and strength by limping sway disabledand art made tongue tied by authority and folly  doctor like  controlling skill and simple truth miscall'd simplicity and captive good attending captain ill   tir'd with all these  from these would i be gone   save that  to die  i leave my love alone thy cheek is pale with thought  but not from woe   and yet so lovely  that if mirth could flush  its rose of whiteness with the brightest blush my heart would wish away that ruder glow and dazzle not thy deep blue eyes  but  oh   while gazing on them sterner eyes will gush   and into mine my mother's weakness rush soft as the last drops round heaven's airy bow for  through thy long dark lashes low depending   the soul of melancholy gentlenessgleams like a seraph from the sky descending   above all pain  yet pitying all distress at once such majesty with sweetness blending   i worship more  but cannot love thee less not from the stars do i my judgement pluck and yet methinks i have astronomy but not to tell of good or evil luck of plagues  of dearths  or seasons' quality nor can i fortune to brief minutes tell pointing to each his thunder  rain and wind or say with princes if it shall go wellby oft predict that i in heaven find but from thine eyes my knowledge i derive and constant stars in them i read such artas 'truth and beauty shall together thrive if from thyself  to store thou wouldst convert'   or else of thee this i prognosticate   'thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date 'why art thou chang'd  o phaon  tell me why love flies reproach  when passion feels decay or  i would paint the raptures of that day when  in sweet converse  mingling sigh with sigh i mark'd the graceful languor of thine eyeas on a shady bank entranc'd we lay o  eyes  whose beamy radiance stole awayas stars fade trembling from the burning sky why art thou chang'd  dear source of all my woes though dark my bosom's tint  through ev'ry veina ruby tide of purest lustre flows warm'd by thy love  or chill'd by thy disdain and yet no bliss this sensate being knows ah  why is rapture so allied to pain i wake  delusive phantoms hence  away tempt not the weakness of a lover's breast the softest breeze can shake the halcyon's nest and lightest clouds o'ercast

spiritchanged thoughts and vile in thee doth weep to find it grieves me that thy mild and gentle mindthose ample virtues which it did inherithas lost  once thou didst loathe the multitudeof blind and madding men  i then loved thee  i loved thy lofty songs and that sweet moodwhen thou wert faithful to thyself and mei dare not now through thy degraded stateown the delight thy strains inspire  in vaini seek what once thou wert  we cannot meetand we were wont  again and yet againponder my words  so the false spirit shall flyand leave to thee thy true integrity wild is the foaming sea  the surges roar and nimbly dart the livid lightnings round on the rent rock the angry waves rebound ah me  the less'ning bark is seen no more along the margin of the trembling shore loud as the blast my frantic cries shall sound my storm drench'd limbs the flinty fragments wound and o'er my bleeding breast the billows pour phaon  return  ye winds  o  waft the strainto his swift bark  ye barb'rous waves forbear taunt not the anguish of a lover's brain nor feebly emulate the soul's despair for howling winds  and foaming seas  in vainassail the breast  when passion rages there so are you to my thoughts as food to life or as sweet season'd showers are to the ground and for the peace of you i hold such strifeas 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found now proud as an enjoyer  and anondoubting the filching age will steal his treasure now counting best to be with you alone then better'd that the world may see my pleasure sometime all full with feasting on your sight and by and by clean starved for a look possessing or pursuing no delight save what is had  or must from you be took   thus do i pine and surfeit day by day   or gluttoning on all  or all away how oft when thou  my music  music play'st upon that blessed wood whose motion soundswith thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'stthe wiry concord that mine ear confounds do i envy those jacks that nimble leap to kiss the tender inward of thy hand whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap at the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand to be so tickled  they would change their stateand situation with those dancing chips o'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait making dead wood more bless'd than living lips   since saucy jacks so happy are in this   give them thy fingers  me thy lips to kiss those lines that i before have writ do lie even those that said i could not love you dearer yet then my judgment knew no reason whymy most full flame should afterwards burn clearer but reckoning time  whose million'd accidentscreep in 'twixt vows  and change decrees of kings tan sacred beauty  blunt the sharp'st intents divert strong minds to the course of altering things alas  why fearing of time's tyranny might i not then say  'now i love you best 'when i was certain o'er incertainty crowning the present  doubting of the rest   love is a babe  then might i not say so   to give full growth to that which still doth grow sweet love  renew thy force  be it not saidthy edge should blunter be than appetite which but to day by feeding is allay'd to morrow sharpened in his former might so  love  be thou  although to day thou fillthy hungry eyes  even till they wink with fulness to morrow see again  and do not killthe spirit of love  with a perpetual dulness let this sad interim like the ocean bewhich parts the shore  where two contracted newcome daily to the banks  that when they seereturn of love  more blest may be the view   or call it winter  which being full of care   makes summer's welcome  thrice more wished  more rare unthrifty loveliness  why dost thou spendupon thy self thy beauty's legacy nature's bequest gives nothing  but doth lend and being frank she lends to those are free then  beauteous niggard  why dost thou abusethe bounteous largess given thee to give profitless usurer  why dost thou useso great a sum of sums  yet canst not live for having traffic with thy self alone thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive then how when nature calls thee to be gone what acceptable audit canst thou leave   thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee   which  used  lives th' executor to be weak is the sophistry  and vain the artthat whispers patience to the mind's despair that bids reflection bathe the wounds of care while hope  with pleasing phantoms  soothes their smart for mem'ry still  reluctant to departfrom the dear spot  once rich in prospects fair bids the fond soul enamour'd there and its least charm is grateful to the heart he never lov'd  who could not muse and sigh spangling the sacred turf with frequent tears where the small rivulet  that ripples by recalls the scenes of past and happier years when  on its banks he watch'd the speaking eye and one sweet smile o'erpaid an age of fears if the dull substance of my flesh were thought injurious distance should not stop my way for then despite of space i would be brought from limits far remote  where thou dost stay no matter then although my foot did standupon the farthest earth remov'd from thee for nimble thought can jump both sea and land as soon as think the place where he would be but  ah  thought kills me that i am not thought to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone but that so much of earth and water wrought i must attend time's leisure with my moan   receiving nought by elements so slow  but heavy tears  badges of either's woe like an advent'rous seafarer am i who hath some long and dang'rous voyage been and  call'd to tell of his discovery how far he sail'd  what countries he had seen proceeding from the port whence he put forth shows by his compass how his course he steer'd when east  when west  when south  and when by north as how the pole to every place was rear'd what capes he doubled  of what continent the gulfs and straits that strangely he had past where most becalm'd  where with foul weather spent and on what rocks in peril to be cast thus in my love  time calls me to relatemy tedious travels and oft varying fate to aetna's scorching sands my phaon flies false youth  can other charms attractive prove say  can sicilian loves thy passions move play round thy heart  and fix thy fickle eyes while in despair the lesbian sappho dies has spring for thee a crown of poppies wove or dost thou languish in th' idalian grove whose altar kindles  fann'd by lover's sighs ah  think  that while on aetna's shores you stray a fire  more fierce than aetna's  fills my breast nor deck sicilian nymphs with garlands gay while sappho's brows with cypress wreaths are drest let one kind word my weary woes repay or  in eternal slumbers bid them rest a witless gallant a young wench that woo'd yet his dull spirit her not one jot could move  entreated me  as e'er i wish'd his good to write him but one sonnet to his love when i  as fast as e'er my pen could trot pour'd out what first from quick invention came nor never stood one word thereof to blot much like his wit that was to use the same but with my verses he his mistress won which doted on the dolt beyond all measure but see  for you to heav'n for phrase i run and ransack all apollo's golden treasure yet by my froth this fool his love obtains and i lose you for all my love and pains no longer mourn for me when i am deadthan you shall hear the surly sullen bellgive warning to the world that i am fledfrom this vile world with vilest worms to dwell nay  if you read this line  remember notthe hand that writ it  for i love you so that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot if thinking on me then should make you woe o  if   i say you look upon this verse when i perhaps compounded am with clay do not so much as my poor name rehearse but let your love even with my life decay   lest the wise world should look into your moan   and mock you with me after i am gone when in the chronicle of wasted timei see descriptions of the fairest wights and beauty making beautiful old rime in praise of ladies dead and lovely knights then  in the blazon of sweet beauty's best of hand  of foot  of lip  of eye  of brow i see their antique pen would have express'deven such a beauty as you master now so all their praises are but propheciesof this our time  all you prefiguring and for they looked but with divining eyes they had not skill enough your worth to sing   for we  which now behold these present days   have eyes to wonder  but lack tongues to praise but do thy worst to steal thyself away for term of life thou art assured mine and life no longer than thy love will stay for it depends upon that love of thine then need i not to fear the worst of wrongs when in the least of them my life hath end i see a better state to me belongsthan that which on thy humour doth depend thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind since that my life on thy revolt doth lie o  what a happy title do i find happy to have thy love  happy to die   but what's so blessed fair that fears no blot   thou mayst be false  and yet i know it not
